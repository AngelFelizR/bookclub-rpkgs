# Advanced testing techniques

**Learning objectives:**

- Test Fixture Strategies
- Effective Helper Function Creation
- Side Effect Management
- Fixture Loading Techniques
- Custom Expectation Development
- Testing Optimization and Skip Handling


## Test Fixtures {-}

When it's not practical to make your test entirely self-sufficient.

- Put repeated code in a constructor-type helper function.
  - If the repeated code has **side effects** make sure to **clean up** afterwards by writing a custom local_*().
  
- Otherwise save the result as a **static file** and load it.

## Creating Helper Function {-}

Creating a helper function make sense if it meet the following conditions:

- Create it takes **several lines of code**.
- The creating process doesn't requires much **time or memory**.

It can be stored under any folder loaded by calling `devtools::load_all()`: 

- Under the `R/` folder as not exported function.
- Under a R script starting with "helper" under the `tests/testthat/`folder.

```r
new_useful_thing <- function() {
  # your fiddly code to create a useful_thing goes here
}
```


## Creating Helper Function {-}

Then you will be able to call it each time needed.

```r
test_that("foofy() does this", {
  useful_thing1 <- new_useful_thing()
  expect_equal(foofy(useful_thing1, x = "this"), EXPECTED_FOOFY_OUTPUT)
})

test_that("foofy() does that", {
  useful_thing2 <- new_useful_thing()
  expect_equal(foofy(useful_thing2, x = "that"), EXPECTED_FOOFY_OUTPUT)
})
```

> In many cases you might found out that the function can be **useful** even for creating **vignettes** and you might end **exporting the function**.

## Avoiding Side Effects {-}

If your functions needs to do any of the following actions you need to **clean up afterwards**:

- Create a file or directory
- Create a resource on an external system
- Set an R option
- Set an environment variable
- Change working directory
- Change an aspect of the tested package's state

## Using `on.exit()` to clean up {-}

```r
neat <- function(x, sig_digits) {
  op <- options(digits = sig_digits)
  on.exit(options(op), add = TRUE, after = FALSE)
  print(x)
}

pi
#> [1] 3.141593
neat(pi, 2)
#> [1] 3.1
pi
#> [1] 3.141593
```

## `on.exit()` Limitations {-}

- You should always call it with `add = TRUE` to ensure that the call is **added to the list** of deferred tasks (instead of replaces).

- You should always call it with `after = FALSE` to ensure that the **cleanup occurs in reverse** order to setup.

- It doesn't work in the global environment for interactive checking.

- You can't wrap up `on.exit()` in a **helper function**.


## Using `withr::defer()` to Clean Up {-}

```r
neat <- function(x, sig_digits) {
  op <- options(digits = sig_digits)
  withr::defer(options(op))
  print(x)
}
```

## `withr::defer()` benefits {-}

- It has the behaviour we want by default; no extra arguments needed.

- It works when called in the global environment thanks to `deferred_run()` and `deferred_clear()` as the global environment isn't perishable.

```r
withr::defer(print("hi"))
#> Setting deferred event(s) on global environment.
#>   * Execute (and clear) with `deferred_run()`.
#>   * Clear (without executing) with `deferred_clear()`.

withr::deferred_run()
#> [1] "hi"
```

- It lets you pick **which function to clean up**. This makes it possible to create helper functions.

```r
local_digits <- function(sig_digits, env = parent.frame()) {
  op <- options(digits = sig_digits)
  withr::defer(options(op), env)
}

neater <- function(x, sig_digits) {
  local_digits(1)
  print(x)
}

neater(pi)
#> [1] 3
```


## Storing as a Static Test Fixture {-}

If a `useful_thing` is **costly to create**, in terms of time or memory. It can be saved in the `tests/testthat/fixtures/` folder, but with its corresponding companion **R script**.

```
.
├── ...
└── tests
    ├── testthat
    │   ├── fixtures
    │   │   ├── make-useful-things.R
    │   │   ├── useful_thing1.rds
    │   │   └── useful_thing2.rds
    │   ├── helper.R
    │   ├── setup.R
    │   └── (all the test files)
    └── testthat.R
```

## Loading a Static Test Fixture {-}

```r
test_that("foofy() does this", {
  useful_thing1 <- readRDS(test_path("fixtures", "useful_thing1.rds"))
  expect_equal(foofy(useful_thing1, x = "this"), EXPECTED_FOOFY_OUTPUT)
})

test_that("foofy() does that", {
  useful_thing2 <- readRDS(test_path("fixtures", "useful_thing2.rds"))
  expect_equal(foofy(useful_thing2, x = "that"), EXPECTED_FOOFY_OUTPUT)
})
```


## Helper Defined Inside a Test {-}

A hyper-local helper like `trunc()` is particularly useful when it allows you to fit all the important business for each expectation on one line. 

```r
# from stringr (actually)
test_that("truncations work for all sides", {

  trunc <- function(direction) str_trunc(
    "This string is moderately long",
    direction,
    width = 20
  )

  expect_equal(trunc("right"),   "This string is mo...")
  expect_equal(trunc("left"),    "...s moderately long")
  expect_equal(trunc("center"),  "This stri...ely long")
})
```

> A helper like trunc() is yet another place where you can **introduce a bug**.

## Custom expectations {-}

- `expect_usethis_error()` checks that an error has the "usethis_error" class.

```r
expect_usethis_error <- function(...) {
  expect_error(..., class = "usethis_error")
}
```

- `expect_proj_file()` is a simple wrapper around file_exists() that searches for the file in the current project.

```r
expect_proj_file <- function(...) {
  expect_true(file_exists(proj_path(...)))
}
```

## Skipping a Test {-}

Sometimes it's impossible to perform a test :

- You may not have an internet connection.
- You may not have access to the necessary credentials.

The only **drawback** is that skipping is completely invisible in CI, so you will need to **dig into the `R CMD check` results**.

## Creating your Own Skip Functions {-}

We can create the helper function.

```r
skip_if_no_api() <- function() {
  if (api_unavailable()) {
    skip("API not available")
  }
}
```

And later used each time needed.

```r
test_that("foo api returns bar when given baz", {
  skip_if_no_api()
  ...
})

test_that("foo api returns an errors when given qux", {
  skip_if_no_api()
  ...
})

```

## Built-in skip() functions {-}

There is a family of skip() functions that anticipate some common situations.

```r
test_that("foo api returns bar when given baz", {
  skip_if(api_unavailable(), "API not available")
  ...
})
test_that("foo api returns bar when given baz", {
  skip_if_not(api_available(), "API not available")
  ...
})

skip_if_not_installed("sp")
skip_if_not_installed("stringi", "1.2.2")

skip_if_offline()
skip_on_cran()
skip_on_os("windows")
```

## Dangers of Skipping {-}

if you automatically skip too many tests, it's easy to fool yourself that all your tests are passing when in fact **they're just being skipped!**

## `skip()` in Summary {-}

```r
devtools::test()
#> ℹ Loading abcde
#> ℹ Testing abcde
#> ✔ | F W S  OK | Context
#> ✔ |         2 | blarg
#> ✔ |     1   2 | foofy
#> ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
#> Skip (test-foofy.R:6:3): foo api returns bar when given baz
#> Reason: API not available
#> ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
#> ✔ |         0 | yo                                                              
#> ══ Results ═════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
#> ── Skipped tests  ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
#> • API not available (1)
#> 
#> [ FAIL 0 | WARN 0 | SKIP 1 | PASS 4 ]
#> 
#> 🥳
```

## Mocking {-}

It is the action of **replacing** something that's:

- _Complicated_
- _Unreliable_
- _Out of our control_

With something that's **fully within our control**.

That is really useful if your package wraps an external API that **requires authentication** or **has occasional downtime**.

## Tools for Mocking {-}

**From `testthat`**

Provide tools for "mocking", temporarily redefining a function so that it behaves differently during tests.

- `with_mocked_bindings()` 
- `local_mocked_bindings()`

Other alternatives:

- `mockery`: https://github.com/r-lib/mockery
- `mockr`: https://krlmlr.github.io/mockr/
- `httptest`: https://enpiar.com/r/httptest/
- `httptest2`: https://enpiar.com/httptest2/
- `webfakes`: https://webfakes.r-lib.org

## Manage credentials {-}

It is likely that you will need to provide a set of test credentials to **fully test your package**.

In that case you can use `httr2 ` which offers substantial support for **secret management**.

```r
usethis::edit_r_environ()
```

Then you can add your key to your user-level `.Renviron` file.

```
YOURPACKAGE_KEY=key_you_generated_with_secret_make_key
```

Now you can restart R

```r
rstudioapi::restartSession()
```

You also can add your key to your workflows.

```yml
    env:
      YOURPACKAGE_KEY: ${{ secrets.YOURPACKAGE_KEY }}
```

## Special considerations for CRAN packages {-}

Situations to use the helper `skip_on_cran()`:

- For long-running tests you might want to skip it as CRAN packages need to run ideally in **less than a minute** in total.

- For valuable, well-written tests that are prone to **occasional nuisance failure** like the accesses a website or web API.

- For snapshot tests (default) used to monitor how various informational messages look.

For CRAN packages you can only write into the session **temp directory** and to **clean up after** yourself.

It is best to **turn off any clipboard** functionality in your tests.
